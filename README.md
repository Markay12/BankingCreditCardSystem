were coded using JavaFXML. 

The JavaFXML represents the XML code file to show the user a GUI of the system and its interactions.

## Operation and Purpose

The purpose of this program as well as its operation is to take customer information for createing a credit card
account.

The information that is provided by the customer is stored in a text file.

## Form Constraints

The constraints on the user interaction creating the non-functional requirements are as follows.

- Each customer has a unique ID (4 digit INT)
- First Name
- Last Name

- Address

In addition to this information the user is asked for a savings and checking account number.

All of these variables are vital to the function of this program and allows the program to run. This program does not
require any further functionality and is merely an example of how to use JavaFX and JavaFXML to develop this program.
